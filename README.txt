--Requirements--

Your solution cannot give the variable the final output value then print it
-you can use if else if else, loops, but no external strings except joining with spaces
-Finally, be creative. I genuinely don't know if my solution is the one that Yahoo would have been looking for. Complete these and send me your unique solutions and maybe in your own unique language
